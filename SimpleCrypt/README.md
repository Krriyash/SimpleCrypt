*This repository contains three Python programs that demonstrate encryption, decryption, and brute-force decryption functionalities.
These programs are implemented using Python and allow users to encrypt and decrypt data based on a Caesar cipher algorithm.*

__**SimpleCrypt**__

This program allows the user to input data and encrypt or decrypt it using a specified shift value. The encrypted data is provided with an encryption key, which can be used to decrypt the data back to its original
form.

---

__**BruteCrypt**__

This program takes encrypted data as input and attempts to decrypt it using a brute-force approach. It systematically tries all possible shift values within a given range to find the most sensible decryption output.

---

__**SimpleBrute**__

This program demonstrates a scoring mechanism based on English letter frequencies to assess the sensibility of decrypted outputs. It enhances the brute-force decryption program by prioritizing decryptions that closely
match English letter frequencies.

**Misc:**

Im quite new to Github, still exploring this vast space, a little overwhelmed by Im getting there. A lot of changes and improvements will follow. Im constantly trying to learn more. Not very skilled yet so we're
gonna have quite a lot of mistakes.

__**Licensing?**__

Honestly, Im not too hellbent on putting up a license for this code, however, It'd be preffered if you would just personally approach me.
